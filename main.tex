Consulting Actuaries Ltd. has prepared this report in accordance with the request of the investment committee of XYZ General Ltd. In accordance with relevant financial services legislation, Consulting Actuaries Ltd. is as Australian Financial Services licence holder and a team of Fellows of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia has permitted sound and legitimate advice given in this report. We understand that XYZ, which writes motor vehicle, home and contents, and building insurance policies, is expanding its policy offerings with electricity blackout insurance (EBI), to be made available to retail and commercial customers in Victoria. We also understand that the committee is seeking advise on how this product would be structured and how it would be received by the customers, as well as using derivative as a tool of risk management.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Electricity market in Australia}
\begin{flushleft}
The electricity system in Australia begins with acquisition of these primary energy sources: sunlight, wind, water, coal and gas.\parencite{aemc1} Historically, coal-fired power stations have played a dominating role in the electricity generation in Australia, but renewables such as sunlight, wind, water are growing rapidly to form a larger fraction of supply.\parencite{aer1} \par

    \caption{Supply Output}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Then the generators make electricity from these sources and flows into the transmission network, which later transports electricity to the distribution network. The distribution network then transports electricity to residential and commercial buildings for end users.\parencite{aemc1} This is shown in the following figure.

\begin{flushleft}
The electricity market in Australia is made up of the:
\begin{itemize}
 \item competitive wholesale generation sector
 \item monopoly network business
 \item competitive retail sector\parencite{aemc2}
\end{itemize}
{\textbf{\large Competitive Wholesale Generation Sector:}}\par
The wholesale national electricity market (NEM) is where generators sell electricity to retailers so they can resell to businesses and households. There are 2 ways in trading electricity in NEM: through spot market or the contract market.\parencite{aemc2} The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) overlooks the states and territories participating in NEM by developing and maintaining the Australian National Electricity Rules (NER). The rules are enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and the day-to-day management of NEM is performed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).\parencite{aemo1} \par
{\textbf{\large Monopoly Network Business:}}\par
The transmission and distribution networks are poles and wires, transformers, switches, monitoring equipment and everything that make up the electricity grid. Given the intensive investment to construct and manage the network, it is cost effective to have a monopoly network service.\parencite{aemc2}\par
{\textbf{\large Competitive Retail Sector:}}\par
In the retail sector, customers such as businesses and households buy electricity through retailers (e.g. Origin). Some large consumers such as manufactures may purchase electricity straight from wholesale market, i.e. through a generator rather than through a retailer.\parencite{aemc2} In this sector, electricity consumption by end users is distributed as the following:

\end{figure}
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Electricity blackout Compensation}
\begin{flushleft}
Under customers compensation scheme, when end users experience power outages beyond set thresholds, they may be entitled to compensations payments from their electricity distributors in their locations, which are known as "Guaranteed Service Level" payments. However, the amount of payments depends on the nature of events, for example the length of time of power interruptions, the number of power interruptions. The payment can go up to \$360 a year.\parencite{cc} \par 
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Electricity Blackouts in Victoria}
\begin{flushleft}
Electricity blackouts can be caused by many reasons:
\begin{itemize}
 \item extreme weather (e.g. lighting, floods, heatwaves, bushfires)
 \item trees contacting power-lines
 \item animals colliding electricity network equipment
 \item vandalism, network overload, underground works or equipment failure\parencite{eb2}\parencite{eb1}
\end{itemize}
Victoria has the most reliable power in Australia.(https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/safety-and-emergencies/power-outages)
some stats as well

\section{Potential Product Structure}
\begin{flushleft}
Explain what EBI would seek to achieve for XYZ and its customers, describing a potential structure for the product and explaining the likelihood and severity of electricity blackouts in Victoria.\par
Note this proposal is merely a guideline of what should be considered in the product design but not the actual product design. \par

What are coverages? What can be claimed? How long?

\subsection{Product}
{\textbf{\large Retail Customers:}}\par
\begin{flushleft}
For retail customers, it might be more attractive to customers to put EBI as an add-on item in their existing household policies.
Household: Food, AC, alarms? Can you make claims under the current policy? \par
https://www.canstar.com.au/news-articles/power-outages-covered-home-insurance/
\end{flushleft}
{\textbf{\large Commercial Customers:}}\par
\begin{flushleft}
For commercial customers, the causes of damages due to an electricity blackout could be quite different. For example, for a supermarket,  it could be the spoil frozen food; for a manufacture, it could be the loss of efficiency in production. Hence, the claim amount could be in a wide range and thus the definition of claims needs to be set with intense care.    

Commercial: Loss of sales/efficiency, impact on bottom line? How to quantify these? Spike in electricity prices?\par
